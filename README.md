# DroneControllerServer
An example server script to use in conjunction with "Drone Controller With Video" app on google playstore.

The provided sample code should work for either python 2 or 3, although it was tested mainly on 2.7. If you're using this code on a raspberry pi, then I suggest trying to get it working on python 2 if possible. This script requires opencv which can be a larger hassel to install properly for python 3 on raspberry pi devices.
